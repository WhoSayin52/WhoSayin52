# Hello World 💻

I'm a self-taught developer striving to be the best at my craft. I enjoy building projects from scratch and contributing to open-source software.
Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in **Graphics Programming** and always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks.

Outside coding, I enjoy **strategy games**, **math puzzles**, and **fitness**—I believe in training both the body and the mind.
